             and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs). Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and

        <item> Running or Running is a terrestrial locomotion method that allows humans
             and other animals move swiftly on foot. Running is a type of gait
             which is characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are on the ground (even though there is
             exception). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always touching
             with the ground, most of the legs are kept straight and the center of gravity vaults over
             horse legs or legs with reverse pendulum style. Characteristics of the body that runs from an angle
             point of view of spring-mass mechanics is that the change in kinetic and potential energy in
             one step occurs simultaneously, with energy storage carried out by the tendons
             suppleness and passive muscle elasticity. [3] The term running can refer to a variety of
             speed from jogging to sprinting.

             So why are there two different terms for football in English?
             So, in the early 1800s, a group of British universities played the same game
             called "football". However, the game and rules are one university with the other
             others are not uniform. That's why the mention of the game is in English too
             varies, depending on the category of the game. One variant that emerged was "rugby
             football" because the game is also done by hand. As for the other variants
             called association football, shortly after the FA was formed in 1863.
